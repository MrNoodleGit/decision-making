We examined data collected from human subjects in a Maze Search Task to study the latent computational process guiding human intuitions when planning under uncertainty. We proposed Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as candidate models of intuitive calculus of decision values. We then developed a set of 3D video stimuli, in which several geometric primitives interacted with each other in a virtual environmentâ€”modeled after a housing facility familiar to a lab monkey. Each stimulus 3D video animation in which the primitives behave either as objects (driven by the laws of physics) or behave as agents (driven by intuitive action utilities and goals).
